## 🎯 Platform Overview

TrueTrend bridges the gap between overwhelming raw diabetes device data and actionable clinical insights. Our platform provides **clinically recognized pattern detection** with **audit-grade evidence** for healthcare professionals and **gentle, supportive guidance** for patients.

### Core Problem We Solve
- **Clinicians**: Overwhelmed by raw CGM/pump data, need clear patterns and evidence
- **Patients**: Struggle to interpret complex glucose trends and device outputs
- **Healthcare Systems**: Lack standardized tools for diabetes data analysis across device types
