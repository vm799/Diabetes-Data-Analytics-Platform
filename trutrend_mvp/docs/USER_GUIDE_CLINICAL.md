  "insulin_units": 8,
  "insulin_timing": "15_minutes_post_meal",
  "carb_ratio_used": "7.5g_per_unit"
}
```

#### Clinical Actions
1. **Review insulin-to-carbohydrate ratio**
2. **Optimize meal insulin timing** (15-20 minutes pre-meal)
3. **Consider rapid-acting insulin type**
4. **Evaluate carbohydrate counting accuracy**

### 2. Mistimed Bolus Detection

#### Definition
Meal insulin administered >10 minutes after meal start with subsequent glucose spike >160 mg/dL.

#### Clinical Significance

  "expected_vs_actual_peak": {
    "expected_peak": 150,
    "actual_peak": 185,
    "difference": 35
  }
}
```

#### Clinical Actions

    }
  ],
  "average_overshoot": 45,
  "recommended_adjustment": "Decrease ratio by 15-20%"
}
```

#### Clinical Actions
