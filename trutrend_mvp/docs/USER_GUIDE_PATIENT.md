## Reading Your Results

### Your Personal Summary

After analysis, you'll receive a patient-friendly summary:

> "We analyzed your recent diabetes data and found some patterns worth discussing with your healthcare team. Your glucose levels tend to rise after meals, particularly dinner. Taking insulin a few minutes before eating might help control these spikes."

### Key Insights You Might See

#### Pattern 1: After-Meal Glucose Spikes
**What it means**: Your glucose goes higher than ideal after eating
**Why it matters**: High glucose after meals can affect how you feel and your long-term health
**What you can do**: 
- Take insulin 10-15 minutes before eating
- Discuss insulin-to-carb ratios with your doctor
- Consider the timing and type of foods you eat

#### Pattern 2: Insulin Timing Issues
**What it means**: You're taking insulin after starting your meal
**Why it matters**: Insulin works best when given before food
**What you can do**:
- Set reminders on your phone
- Take insulin when you start cooking
- Talk to your doctor about insulin types

#### Pattern 3: Carb Counting Challenges
**What it means**: Similar meals are causing different glucose responses
**Why it matters**: Consistent carb counting helps predict insulin needs
**What you can do**:
- Use a food scale for accuracy
- Learn about hidden carbs in foods
- Keep a detailed food diary

### Understanding Your Numbers

#### Glucose Targets (General Guidelines)
- **Before meals**: 80-130 mg/dL
- **2 hours after meals**: Less than 180 mg/dL
- **Bedtime**: 100-140 mg/dL

*Note: Your doctor may set different targets based on your specific situation*

#### Time in Range
This shows how much time your glucose was in your target range:
- **Excellent**: 70% or more
- **Good**: 50-70%
- **Needs improvement**: Less than 50%

### Sample Patient Report

```
üìä Your Diabetes Insights

üéØ Time in Target Range: 68%
üìà Average Glucose: 145 mg/dL
‚ö° Glucose Variability: Moderate

üçΩÔ∏è Meal Pattern Insights:
‚Ä¢ Breakfast: Usually well-controlled
‚Ä¢ Lunch: Some spikes noticed
‚Ä¢ Dinner: Often goes above target

üí° Key Recommendations:
1. Try taking dinner insulin 15 minutes before eating
2. Consider smaller portions or different timing for lunch
3. Keep tracking - you're doing great overall!

üìù Questions for Your Doctor:
‚Ä¢ Should we adjust my dinner insulin dose?
